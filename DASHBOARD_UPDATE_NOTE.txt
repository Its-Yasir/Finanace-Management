Complete updated dashboard.html with income feature.

See the implementation guide in INCOME_FEATURE.md for manual integration.

Key changes needed:
1. Add "Add Income" button in Quick Actions (line ~98)
2. Add income modal before script tag (line ~136)
3. Update JavaScript imports and logic (line ~139-243)

I recommend following the INCOME_FEATURE.md guide which has all the code ready to copy-paste.

Quick Summary:
- Income feature functions are ready in app.js
- Add Expense button is fixed
- Just need to add UI elements to dashboard.html
